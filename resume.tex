    \section{Wishes}
    This is a little section I wanted to dedicate to myself.

    \medskip
    Most of the stuff that I have learnt was autodidact; books, internet, blogs, wikis and videos. 
    Being \textbf{\href{https://lukesmith.xyz/}{Luke Smith}} my mentor.

    \medskip
    I'd love to create a foundation with the objective of promoting freedom ideas and promoting libre software, trying to reach more people

    \medskip
    By a more personal and not laboral side... In the future I'd love to have a band, and play a lot with my artistical side.\\
    And cannot discard the idea of experimenting with IT related lyrics!
